# META-BOOTSTRAP

### What is *Meta Bootstrap?*

*Meta-bootstrap* aims to be a drop-in library one level of abstraction higher than Bootstrap. If you think of bootstrap as branding + a basic UI kit, Meta-bootstrap would be a universal set of generic sections and components that extends bootstrap.

This way, you can stop recreating the same basic components and move on to designing pages at a higher level-of-abstraction.
